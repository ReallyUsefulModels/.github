## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to Really Useful Models or RUM. We are a not-for-profit whose mission is to bring open-source system dynamics modelling to the world.<br />

🌈 Contribution guidelines - You can get involved by submitting pull requests, ideas or just sending us a message.<br />

Please feel free to contribute or upload any models you have. We recommend using streamlit cloud to deploy them which can be found here: https://streamlit.io/ 

If you are not a coder we recommend using a GPT chat model of your choice to work out how to build and deploy the apps for the more adventurous among you.

To set the environment up to start coding clone a template app using:

```sh
git clone
```

Then make sure pipenv is installed:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```
Followed by:

```sh
pipenv install
```

Then to start the shell call
```sh
pipenv shell
```

And you can either launch a juptyer-lab notebook from here or run the program in any development environment of your choosing. We recommend VScode for those without a strong preference. 

👩‍💻 Useful resources - The pypi repository for ASDM can be found here: (https://pypi.org/project/asdm/). Here you will also find the ASDM setup guide.<br />
