## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to Really Useful Models or RUM. We are a not-for-profit whose mission is to bring open-source system dynamics modelling to the world.<br />
🌈 Contribution guidelines - You can get involved by submitting pull requests, ideas or just sending us a message.<br />

Please feel free to contribute or upload any models you have. We recommend using streamlit cloud to deploy them which can be found here: https://streamlit.io/ 

If you are not a coder we recommend using a GPT chat model of your choice to work out how to build and deploy the apps for the more adventurous among you.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - our central website is hosted at www.reallyusefulmodels.com (still under construction) but this will be the best place to find all the resources.<br />
🧙 What's Coming Next? The first python SD models are now available with more to follow.
